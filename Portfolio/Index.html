<h2>About me&nbsp;</h2>

  <p><strong>I originally grew up in Houston, Texas. The town was often very crowded, and as you can expect, extremely hot.&nbsp;Houston is not necessaraly a bad place to live, in fact some spots of the city are absolutely mesmerizing. However, you have to be able to put up with the following well:

      <li><strong>Environment</strong></li>
      </ol>
    <li><strong>Extreme heat </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Frequent venomous reptiles such as copperheads</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Storms strong enough to knock down trees
      </strong>
      <ol start="2">
        <li><strong>People constantly upset due to the heat getting to their heads</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Lots of beautiful spots turned into concrete jungles</strong></li>
        </ol>

  <p><strong>Growing up in Houston, Texas is a unique experience filled with vibrant diversity, rich culture, and a strong sense of community. As the fourth largest city in the United States, Houston offers a dynamic and ever-evolving environment that shapes the lives of its residents.Sports play a significant role in the lives of Houstonians, and growing up here means being immersed in a city passionate about its teams. From the Houston Astros in baseball to the Houston Texans in football, the city rallies behind its athletes, fostering a strong sense of pride and camaraderie among young sports enthusiasts. Whether playing Little League baseball or cheering for their favorite teams, growing up in Houston means being part of a sports-centric community that celebrates the thrill of competition.The city's geography also shapes the experience of growing up in Houston. With its proximity to the Gulf Coast, Houston offers a warm and humid climate that encourages an active outdoor lifestyle. From exploring the lush parks and trails to enjoying water activities like boating or swimming, Houston provides ample opportunities for young residents to appreciate nature and stay physically active. However, growing up in Houston also presents its share of challenges. The city's size and sprawling nature can lead to long commutes and traffic congestion, impacting daily routines and family time. Additionally, Houston's hot and humid summers can be intense, requiring individuals to adapt to the weather and find ways to beat the heat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once I turned 9, me and my family ended up moving to Apex, North Carolina. This was a huge change in both scenery, and living. The weather is almost a complete 180 turn, the amount of snow we got on the first year was enough for me to immediately fall in love with the place. Our rental home that we had at the time was about twice the size of the house we had lived in all of my life in Texas. Whilst I certainly missed my friends and family back home, I was more than ready to start a new life here. The original plan was to only stay here for a year, but after my dad got a great job offer, 1 year turned into 10. I have absolutely no doubt that I am happier here than I would be back in Texas, the weather there just ends up getting you down after a while, but in North Carolina, the weather is almost never the same. One day it will be a crisp 60 degrees, and the next it will be 82. The cities in North Carolina are far smaller, but I actually prefer that. It is much less stressful to drive in, as well as easier to navigate overall. The historical buildings and number of museums is amazing, and leaves you constantly with something you can do in your freetime. North Carolina, while far from home, was a great place to have a new one.</strong></p>
