<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">When I first moved to North Carolina, the first school that I attended was olive Chapel elementary. This was an amazing first school, the staff was amazing, and the actual architecture of the school was very easy to understand. I first came in 4th grade, and our classrooms were outside in smaller buildings. This was something I wasn't used to, and it was an interesting change that I enjoyed. My 5th grade classes were both inside the school directly down the entrance hall, so it was extremely easy to find them. Both of my teachers were amazing, my science teacher especially. He is primarily the reason that I am as fascinated with science as I am today. I owe a lot to the school, as when I first moved here I was nervous about a lot of things, and it was great for school to not be one of those worries. This is where I met a ton of my childhood friends. Whilst today I don't talk to all but one of them, it was nice being able to pick up friends so quickly after leaving a lot of them behind. To this day I still think back to the days in science class where my teacher would have short breaks during rainy days for us to look out the window and every day he would turn it into a chance for him to talk about the science of the weather. I cannot think of a better introduction to North Carolina, then this school was.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'201341983':0,'335559739':160,'335559740':259}"> </span></p>
<h2>East Cary Middle School&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">Once I graduated from elementary school, the next school I went to was east Cary middle school. The reason I went to this school and not a middle school within the apex district, was because during the middle of 5th grade, me and my family ended up moving down to our permanent residence in Cary. East Cary middle was where I discovered more about what I wanted to do later in life, as well as discovered a few new hobbies. One of my favorite electives that I attended during Est Cary middle was band class. My band teacher was amazing, he would often make jokes in the class, and made sure that none of us were being left behind when it came to understanding the instrument that we had. I continued band class up until the end of 7th grade, and once my band teacher had left the school, that's whenever I decided that I was going to stop. My time at ECMS offered me a ton of opportunities for me to learn what I wanted to learn, I even picked up some classes in interior design. Overall, this was an amazing oppurtunity to meet new people, and expand what I already knew, as well as pick up some new stuff as well.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'201341983':0,'335559739':160,'335559740':259}"> </span></p>
<h2>Cary High School&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">middle school, I moved right down the road to Cary high school. The four years spent in the school are almost indescribable. The first year and 1/2 was amazing, I got to meet tons of new people as well as seeing some of my old friends from middle school, and got used to the layout of the school, which i found complicated at first but later got used to it. I picked up some electives that looked fun such as German, marine ecology, and theater. The first year and a half went by somewhat slow, I was constantly stressed out since I was still getting used to high school, and I often would have a rather sizable workload. Once I got to the middle of sophomore year, that&rsquo;s when COVID-19 hit. This caused me to be an online learning until the very end of junior year, a large amount of high school to miss. Online learning for me was to have first, getting used to logging in it different times for each class, sometimes having asynchronous days, and sometimes not having work to do at all. I continued to push on and eventually they started pulling small amounts of students in at once, when I finally entered the school after a year, it felt odd. The hallways were quiet, the school was cold, it almost felt eerie. At once, there was about 300 students in the school, every classroom was nearly empty. All of this came to an end once senior year started, the mask mandate had ended, and everyone was welcome back into school. This was once again a strange feeling, being surrounded by so many people in such small rooms, it was something that I'm sure everybody had a hard time adjusting to. This is primarily what made my high school years feel very odd, and indescribable. It was a great chance for me to learn what I wanted to do in college, as the time spent online learning got me more used to working with computers, i decided to also pick U computer classes. That is how I got to where I am today. In a way, I guess COVID-19 was not all bad, as i have it to thank for my current love for technology.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'201341983':0,'335559739':160,'335559740':259}"> </span></p>
