<h1>Major </h1>
<h2>Cybersecurity&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So, why is cybersecurity such a sought after and loved major? Well, there is a ton of different answers to that, but we can sum them up to these:</p>
<ol type="I">
  <ol>
    <li>Concvinience</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Most (not all) jobs under the cybersecurity field allow you to work remotely, this can be easier for someone taking care of a family or something that requires you to be present at home for a certain amount of time.</li>
  <li>Assuming the job you landed was capable to be a remote job, this would not be affected by any pandemics that require people to stay at home, so for you, nothing really changes.</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity is often a far less stressful job than other typical 9-5s. The reason for this is, the job is set up in a way where you can get work done at your pace, at your convinience. Of course, if something drastic were to occur, it would still fall to you to solve that issue in a timely manner.
    <ol start="2">
      <li>The pay for most cybersecurity jobs is often enough to supply entire familes, and far more than enough for someone who is just watching over themselves.</li>
      <li>Tons of different oppurtunities. This goes to say that there are lots of jobs that need websites or servers to be up to date with the strongest hacking prevention softwares they can get, and with technology becoming more and more relevant to the field, this job is having far more demand each year than it did the previous, so finding a job is not difficult.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>A significant portion of a cybersecurity professional's day is dedicated to ongoing maintenance and security operations. This involves managing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and antivirus software to ensure they are up to date and functioning optimally. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing are conducted to identify weaknesses in the system and address them promptly. They also collaborate with other IT teams to implement security best practices and ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards. Another crucial aspect of their work is incident response. When a security incident occurs, such as a data breach or a malware attack, cybersecurity professionals play a critical role in investigating the incident, containing the damage, and restoring the affected systems. This involves conducting forensic analysis, documenting the incident, and implementing remediation measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Collaboration and communication are also key aspects of a cybersecurity professional's daily work. They work closely with IT teams, management, and stakeholders to understand the organization's security needs and develop comprehensive strategies. They also provide guidance and training to employees on security best practices to promote a culture of cybersecurity awareness. As a cybersecurity professional, individuals are entrusted with the critical task of safeguarding digital systems and data from cyber threats. Their work involves a wide range of responsibilities, including identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security measures, and responding to incidents. This goes to say that there will be a lot of trust put into you, and it is very important you know what you are doing. A simple mistake can result in a hack from an external source, resulting in the loss of either money, trust, important files, or all of the above.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity certainly might seem like a simple job that you can do from home, but it is anything but simple. Sure, it is possible to work from home, but some days you will need to come in to check up on certain systems. It is not just a sit back and relax job, it can be demanding and stressful. The ever-changing threat landscape and the need to protect against sophisticated attacks require individuals to be alert and responsive at all times. You must also stay composed under pressure during incident response situations. While it is a fun job, if you know what you are doing, it is also to be taken very seriously, as you are not just protecting your job, but the jobs of others as well.</p>
